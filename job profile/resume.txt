 Led the full transformation of a decade-old monolithic enterprise healthcare platform into a scalable, production-grade **micro-frontend architecture** using **React**, **Next.js**, and **Webpack Module Federation**.
 Assessed limitations of the legacy architecture and developed a phased migration strategy that separated UI domains into independent verticals, allowing parallel development by cross-functional teams without disrupting live clinical workflows.
 Designed and implemented a **shared shell application** responsible for loading remote micro-frontends at runtime, managing global authentication contexts (Auth0), injecting layout templates, and dynamically registering routes and menu configurations from remote JSON schemas.
 Architected inter-application communication protocols via **custom event buses**, React Contexts, and shared state synchronization mechanisms to ensure seamless interaction across independently deployed modules.
 Developed tooling and CLI scaffolds to bootstrap new micro-apps with pre-wired CI/CD pipelines, linting standards, shared tokens, automated integration with Nx monorepo workspace, and strict TypeScript enforcement.
 Collaborated closely with product, UX, and accessibility teams to define **domain boundaries**, user flows, and WCAG-compliant design patterns that scaled across tenant-branded microfrontends.
 Spearheaded the integration of advanced **SSR/ISR strategies** in Next.js to handle pre-rendering for static and dynamic views, optimizing performance for low-latency dashboard rendering under high user concurrency.
 Introduced build-time and runtime analytics for each micro-frontend including Lighthouse audits, error telemetry, and feature-level usage dashboards for business intelligence reviews.
 Achieved significant **engineering velocity gains**, reducing average feature delivery time by 40%, and empowering teams to ship independently versioned components with full regression test automation baked into the CI/CD lifecycle.
 Delivered advanced SSR/ISR configurations using Next.js with edge caching and analytics hooks, supporting high-availability dashboards with sub-1s TTI.
 Created an adaptive layout framework to dynamically host federated frontends with route injection, role-based navigation control, and config-driven menu builders.
 Built enterprise-grade component libraries with full accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), design token integration, and Storybook-driven documentation and snapshot testing.
 Integrated GraphQL endpoints through Apollo with schema stitching, advanced cache eviction, and analytics-augmented interceptor chains.
 Developed forms-as-a-platform modules using Formik, Zod/Yup, and server-sourced validation contracts, enabling distributed form authorship.
 Integrated real-time telemetry via SignalR and Azure Event Grid into dashboards with live charting (D3.js), heat maps, and threshold alerting overlays.
 Led front-end CI/CD design using Azure DevOps with audit snapshot hooks, auto-tag pipelines, and ESLint/Prettier/husky enforcement at commit-time.
 Established organization-wide coding standards, linting presets, and scaffold generators for Next.js microfrontends using Nx monorepo tooling.
 Achieved Lighthouse 100 scores across all major KPIs; led monthly UX performance reviews and regression triages.
 Conducted workshops on advanced hooks, scalable state management patterns (Zustand/Redux Toolkit), and design system governance.
 Authored 100+ pages of onboarding content and pattern documentation; maintained Docusaurus portal for architectural literacy across teams.
 Built telemetry dashboards for behavior monitoring with Application Insights, custom event traces, and behavior tagging for stakeholder reviews.
 Delivered robust i18n and theming support across tenants using context-driven tokens and Next.js middleware for language routing.
 Led multi-phase transition to strict TypeScript modes with 150+ refactored components, shared tsconfig bases, and lint rule extensions.
